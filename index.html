                    current lockdown restrictions, that VR increases memory retention over conventional teaching methods

                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Robert Hills, but known to my friends and colleagues as Rob. I have always had a
                        keen interest in all things computing, so decided (somewhat later in life than most) to fulfil
                        a life’s ambition of obtaining a degree in something that I enjoy and want to make a career of.
                        I have now finished my degree, achieving a BSc(hons) Applied Computing (First-class) from the
                        University of Bath.<br><br>
                        The challenge presented on the course was welcomed and enjoyed, even through the frustration of
                        something initially not doing what it was intended to do. The course covered a multitude of
                        programming skills, such as, Database design (Oracle and MySQL), Java (Android Applications and
                        Multithreading), Web design and building (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP), Game/VR Design (Unity and
                        C#), Visual Basic, and Cyber Security (Basics and Forensics), utilising varied IDE's.<br><br>
                        Much of my career has been customer centric in sales and operational management roles,
                        so, understand the empathy and integrity required in maintaining solid customer
                        relationships. I have experience in data analytics, primarily to produce
                        Management Information, and in software project management through the development of Total
                        Accident Management's in-house repair and claims ERP, e-Point.<br><br>
                        I realise there is much to learn and am now looking to further my understanding of programming
                        and the development lifecycle.
                    </p>
