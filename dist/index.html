                <p>This application was developed to answer the hypothesis <strong>"Does VR training have a practical
                        application in aeronautical engineering?"</strong>. The project conculded, although
                    undetermined in answering the hypothesis due to lack of suitably qualified participants during the
                    current lockdown restrictions, that VR increases memory retention over conventional teaching methods
                    for technical terminology.</p>

                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Robert Hills, but known to my friends and collegues as Rob. I have always had a
                        keen interest in all things computing, so decided (somewhat later in life than most) to fullfil
                        a lifes ambition of obtaining a degree in something that I enjoy and want to make a career of. I
                        have now finished my degree, obtaining a First Class BSc(hons) Applied Computing from the
                        Universtiy of Bath.<br><br>
                        The challenge presented on the course was welcomed and enjoyed, even through the frustration of
                        something initially not doing what it was intended to do. The course covered a multitude of
                        programming skills, such as, Database design (Oracle and MySql), Java (Android Applications and
                        Multithreading), Web design and building (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP), Game/VR Design (Unity and
                        C#), Visual Basic, and Cyber Security (Basics and Forensics), utilising varied IDE's.<br><br>
                        The majority of my career has been customer centric in sales and operational management roles,
                        so understand the empathy and integrity required in maintaining solid customer
                        relationships.<br><br>
                        I realise there is much to learn and am now looking to further my understanding of programming
                        with a goal of advancing into Cyber Security.
