                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Robert Hills, but known to my friends and colleagues as Rob. I have always had a
                        keen interest in all things computing, so decided (somewhat later in life than most) to fulfil
                        a life’s ambition of obtaining a degree in something that I enjoy and want to make a career of.
                        I have now finished my degree, achieving a BSc(hons) Applied Computing (First-class) from the
                        University of Bath.<br><br>
                        The challenges that programming presents is welcomed and enjoyed, even through the frustration
                        of
                        something initially not doing what it was intended to do and the resultant jubilation of solving
                        it. I have experience in,
                        Database design (Oracle and MySQL), Java (Android Applications and
                        Multithreading), Web design and building (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP), Game/VR Design (Unity and
                        C#), Visual Basic, Networking, and Cyber Security (Basics and Forensics), utilising various
                        IDE's and commercial experience (as per my CV) in • C# ASP.NET + core (MVC), MS SQL Server,
                        T-SQL, Database First via Redgate Readyroll,
                        Octopus Deploy, Knockout TS (MVVM), SCSS, jQuery, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, TFS, Azure
                        DevOps, Angular, Umbraco CMS,
                        code and database first approaches.<br><br>
                        FTP and DevOps to more efficiently manage the development lifecycle.<br><br>
                        Further personal time has been and will continue to be spent in advancing my programming skills,
                        as can
                        be seen with the addition of React and Django projects to my GitHub (constanly being updated
                        with new work) repositories and inclusion
                        on this site - recent addition being a microservices application.<br><br>
                        Much of my career has been customer centric in sales and operational management roles,
                        so, understand the empathy and integrity required in maintaining solid customer
                        relationships. I have experience in data analytics, primarily to produce
                        Management Information, and in software project management through the development of Total
                        Accident Management's in-house repair and claims ERP, e-Point.<br><br>
                        I realise there is much to learn and am now looking forward to furthering my understanding of
                        programming and the development lifecycle. I know I have the determination to see things through
                        and am willing and able to learn new techniques, which I reinforced during and on completion of
                        my degree.
